      <li>London appears to have the most ghost sitings of these three cities.</li>
      <li>Parisian officials have done a bad job of obscuring their ghost problem by subtracting from the results.</li>
      <li>Tehran has enjoyed some success managing their ghost problem, possibly related to their hosting of Bill Murray and three of his associates.</li>
